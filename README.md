# Transmetro Path

A simple one endpoint API to find paths in the Transmetro network.

Note: This is only a mirror repository. There is no access to data folder so you cannot build the db and use the API. 

More info about how it works [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VXjeXfBLbH24kWVYLDTSAWHr7D0rYPKHgbgkgTW1Swc/edit?usp=sharing). Spanish only.

## What I learned

* Geolocation
* Intro to Mongo DB. Finally found a project where NOSQL features were applicable
* Creation of a DB from different data sources
* FastAPI Basics
* Abstraction of real problems to code
* Logging Basics
